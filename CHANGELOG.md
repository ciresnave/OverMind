# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- user-request: durable pending requests (`submit`, `begin_answer`, `withdraw`, `bound_hash`; PR #125).
- **Breaking:** `store::Attempt` gained the public field `pending: Option<String>`, so code that builds an `Attempt` by struct literal must set it (nothing in this workspace does).
